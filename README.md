# __HumBirds__

In this world of 7.8 billion population, many people are still lonely, friendless, sad and depressed. Specially in current corona affected locked down life, people are getting more and more isolated, and having no friends to talk with leaves a large negative impact on our mental health. Though we are surrounded with thousands of unknown 'friends' in social media applications, still we don't know how many of them have similar mentality, taste and choices like us . We can get matches in dating apps, but can't convert it into long-lasting relationship due to different tastes and choices.


So here comes our android application <b><i>HumBirds </i></b> , a musical social media platform, that enables us to connect with people of similar music taste all around the world. Connect with people, break the ice by talking about favourite artists, podcasts, or audio-books, share your thoughts, hang out at concerts, create great bondings and even try your luck at Cupid's household, all through a beautiful musical journey. HumBirds gurantees a certain level of similar taste between the connected users. So surround yourself with great alike friends from all around the world, speak your heart out, and break free from your boring lonely life.
